Head motion tracking for gaming.

Introduction
This project originated from my need make leaning in first-person-shooter games easiert. Games that enable you to lean around corners to peak or take a shot with giving the enemy the smallest possible target, like PlayerUnknown Battleground or Tom Clancy's Six Siege usually implemet leaning with the keyboard keys 'Q' and 'E'. While it is quite the obvious choice to use the keys close to the usual movement-keys 'W'/'A'/'S'/'D', it is quite hard to use if you need to crouch, move and lean at the same time. There just aren't enough fingers.
My idea to the problem was to implement a simple device that tracks my head motion to trigger and hold the respective lean movement.
